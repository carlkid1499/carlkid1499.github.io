# Smart Garden Project

### Summary

Are you a person who likes plants?
Are you a person who likes to travel?
If that is you, you are not alone. I designed this project so
that you can have some piece of mind while away.

##### The main points of this project are as follows:

1. On/Off grow lights based off a schedule
2. On/Off a water pump based off a schedule
3. RTC to keep track of the time
4. Log data and errors to an SD card.
