# Smart Garden Project

### Summary

The main purpose of this project is to have a self sufficient garden while travling for a few days upto a few weeks. It also needs to be somewhat cost efficient.

##### The main points of this project are as follows:

1. On/Off grow lights based on a schedule
2. On/Off water pump(s) based on a schedule
3. RTC to keep track of the time for schedule
4. Log data and errors to an SD card.
5. PhotoCells to keep track of light intensity.
