## Welcome to my GitHub Page

Below you will find a list of my current projects I am working on.

### Smart Garden Project
As a college student I do a lot of travaling especially during school breaks.
This presents me with an issue. I love plants but how am I going to water and tend to them them while I am away. I can have someone else do it for me but that isn't always reliable. I can minimize my trips to a few days but that's not fun. The solution is to have a self suffient garden that can go without a human for a few days up to a few weeks at a time.

I introduce to you the [Smart Garden Project](http://carlossantosdev.me/pages/smart_garden_project).
